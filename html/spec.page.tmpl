    <main>
        <p>
            The goal of this specification is to understand how we render plain text lists.
            The overall design of this format is to be simple and easy parse and render.  List
            items are separated by newline characters <code>\n</code>. Each block type can be determined by
            reading the first two characters of a line.
        </p>

        <p>
            The source code for our own parser can be found
            <a href="https://github.com/neurosnap/lists.sh/pkg/parser.go">here</a>.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-xl">List item</h2>
        <p>
            Each list item is on its own line.  A list item does not require any special formatting.
            A list item can contain as much text as it wants.  We encourage soft wraping for readability
            in your editor of choice.  Hard wrapping is not permitted as it will create a new list item.
        </p>
        <p>
            Empty list items are permitted but no more than one consecutive empty list item at a time.
            We also remove the last list item if it is empty.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-xl">Hyperlinks</h2>
        <p>
            Hyperlinks are denoted by the prefix <code>=></code>.  The following text should then be
            the hyperlink.
        </p>
        <pre>=> https://lists.sh</pre>
        <p>Optionally you can supply the hyperlink text immediately following the link.</p>
        <pre>=> https://lists.sh microblog for your lists</pre>

        <h2 class="text-xl">Headers</h2>
        <p>
            List items can be represented as headers.  We support two headers currently.
        </p>
        <pre># Header One
## Header Two</pre>

        <h2 class="text-xl">Blockquotes</h2>
        <p>
            List items can be represented as blockquotes.
        </p>
        <pre>> This is a blockquote.</pre>

        <h2 class="text-xl">Variables</h2>
        <p>
            Variables allow us to store metadata within our system.  Variables are list items with
            key value pairs denoted by <code>=@</code> followed by the key and then a whitespace character
            and then the value.
        </p>
        <pre>=@publish_at 2022-04-20</pre>
        <p>These variables will not be rendered to the user.</p>
        <p>List of known variables:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>title (custom title not dependent on filename)</li>
            <li>description (description of list)</li>
            <li>publish_at (format must be <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code>)</li>
        </ul>
    </main>
