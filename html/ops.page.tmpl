        <p>
            lists.sh exists to allow people to create and share their lists
            without the need to set up their own server or be part of a platform
            that shows ads or tracks its users.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-xl">Ethics</h2>
        <p>We are committed to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>No tracking of user or visitor behaviour.</li>
            <li>Never sell any user or visitor data.</li>
            <li>No ads â€” ever.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-xl">Code of Content Publication</h2>
        <p>
            Content in lists.sh blogs is unfiltered and unmonitored. Users are free to publish any
            combination of words and pixels except for: content of animosity or disparagement of an
            individual or a group on account of a group characteristic such as race, colour, national
            origin, sex, disability, religion, or sexual orientation, which will be taken down
            immediately.
        </p>

            <ul>

                    The user is responsible for all content posted and all actions performed with

                    We reserve the right to disable or delete a user's account for any reason at
                    any time. We have this clause because, statistically speaking, there will be
                    people trying to do something nefarious.
