        <h2 class="text-xl">What should my blog folder look like?</h2>
        <p>
            Currently <a href="/">lists.sh</a> only supports a flat folder structure.  Therefore,
            <code>scp -r</code> is not permitted.  We also only allow <code>.txt</code> files to be
            uploaded.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/neurosnap/lists-blog">Here is the source to my blog on this platform</a>
        </p>
        <p>
        Below is an example of what your blog folder should look like:
        </p>
            <pre>blog/
first-post.txt
second-post.txt
third-post.txt</pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            Underscores and hyphens are permitted and will be automatically removed from the title of the list.
        </p>

    <section>
        <h2 class="text-xl">How do I update a list?</h2>
        <p>
            Updating a list requires that you update the source document and then run the <code>scp</code>
            command again.  If the filename remains the same, then the list will be updated.

    <section>
        <h2 class="text-xl">How do I delete a list?</h2>
        <p>
            Because <code>scp</code> does not natively support deleting files, I didn't want to bake
            that behavior into my ssh server.  Instead, in order to delete a list, you need to
            <code>ssh lists.sh</code> and select "Manage posts."  Then you can highlight the post you
            want to delete and then press "X."  It will ask for comfirmation before actually removing
            the list.
